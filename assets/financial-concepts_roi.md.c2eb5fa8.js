It measures the amount of return or profit generated by an investment relative to its cost.</p><p>The formula for ROI is:</p><div class="language-"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki material-theme-palenight"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) x 100%</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Net Profit is the total return generated by the investment, minus the cost of the investment. The Cost of Investment includes all costs associated with the investment, such as purchase price, fees, and other expenses.</p><p>For example, if an investor purchases stock for $10,000 and sells it a year later for $12,000, the net profit would be $2,000.

<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This means that the investor earned a 20% return on their investment over the course of one year.</p><p>ROI is a useful metric for evaluating the performance of investments, as it provides a simple and straightforward measure of profitability that can be used to compare different investments. However, it is important to keep in mind that ROI does not take into account the time value of money or other factors such as risk and inflation, and should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics and analysis when making investment decisions.</p>`,9),i=[o];function r(c,l,p,h,d,m){return t(),s("div",null,i)}const v=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,v as default};
