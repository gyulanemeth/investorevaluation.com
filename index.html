				<h1>Investor Evaluation and Comparision for Startups</h1>
				<p>How to evaluate and compare your potentional investors' offers to make educated decisions based on data.</p>
			</header>
			<p>You are most likely a startup founder, and you are thinking about accepting an investment offer. That is great, it means that someone thinks that your idea is worth for an investment. Believe me, that's an amazing sign.</p>
<p>You might have multiple offers and you want to compare those. Even better. But if you don't have at least two offers, I definitely suggest you to find more potentional investors. It's much better if you have options and you can decide which one to accept.</p>
<p>By reading this document, you will have a good understanding of how to evaluate and compare investors in order to maximize the cash landing in your pocket in the event of an exit. Besides that, you will understand why investors are searching for exponential growth - that they call the hockey-stick in your revenue growth chart (that you can see below) and what are the mechanisms behind the payouts in an exit-scenario.</p>
<div class="canvas-wrapper"><canvas id="exponential-growth"></canvas></div>
<p>My fundamental assumption is that you are a startup's (co-)founder, who eventually wants to sell their company and you are looking for ways to evaluate different investment offers.</p>
<p>Let's get into this, shall we?</p>
<h2 id="howtoevaluateandcompareinvestors">How to Evaluate and Compare Investors</h2>
<p>The most probably important thing when you evaluate an investor is their <strong>domain knowledge</strong>. The questions you should ask are "Do they understand your business?" and "Do they have projects related to your business?". If the answers are yes, that's a good sign. You should go for investor who have experience in your field and can help you to build your company.</p>
<p>The other extremely important thing is their <strong>network</strong>. If they are well-connected, that means they can introcude you to relevant people or compaines. They can also help you to establish strategic partnerships, and help you to get resources that you otherwise could not get. You can also take a look at their <strong>track-record</strong> and how active they are in the recent time-period.</p>
<p>All of the things above are all about their ability to build your company and the business itself. These things can help you a lot to reach to the point when you can exit your company. Beside those, you should carefully examine what kind of legal rights they will have, but this is really out of the scope of this document.</p>
<p>In the case of an exit, the most important thing is how much money will end up in your pocket. This is way more than the equity you have, there are multiple factors that affect the amount of cash you will have. You should definitely <strong>analyze as many exit scenarios as you can</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="howtoevaluateanexitscenario">How to Evaluate an Exit-Scenario</h2>
<p>You might think that the most important thing to take into consideration when you decide to accept an investment are the amount of <strong>capital</strong> and the <strong>shares</strong> you give up in exchange. They are very important indeed, but besides those, it's really, really important to take into account their <strong>yield expectation</strong> (which is similar to paying an interest for them) and even more importantly if they offer <strong>catch-up</strong> or not.</p>
<p>When you sell the whole company, the following things happen in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payout 1: Capital + yield expectation</li>
<li>Payout 2: Catch-up (optional)</li>
<li>Payout 3: Shares</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="payout1capitalplusyieldexpectation">Payout 1: Capital Plus Yield Expectation</h3>
<p>First of all, the investor will get back the <strong>capital plus the yield expectation</strong> accumulated throughtout the years. It means that the later you sell the company, the more interest they will get. For example, let's say that the investor puts $1 million in your company with 20% interest rate. Let's say that you sell the whole company after 3 years. In this case, the investor will get $1M * 1.2^3 = $1.728M even before taking the amount of shares into account. It means, that even before taking shares into account, they will get $728.000 more back than the amount they put in. This is the exponential part of the equation. The later you sell the company, the more yield the investor will get:</p>
<div class="canvas-wrapper"><canvas id="yield-expectation"></canvas></div>
<p>It basically means, that if your company can only grow in a linear fashion, not exponential, and if you can't sell the company in time, then you might be better of without an investor. But we will get back to this a little bit later.</p>
<h3 id="payout2catchup">Payout 2: Catch-up</h3>
<p>The second stage of the payout is the <strong>catch-up</strong>. If your potentional investor does not offer full catch-up, then just don't pick them. The catch-up is basically a mechanism that will rule out the <strong>capital + interest</strong> part of the equation if (and only if) the exit is big enough. It means that if you have a desired big exit, then the eventual amount of money your investor will get is exacly the same as if they would only get money based on the amount of shares they have. In other words, the expected company value equals the sum of the capital, yield expectation and the catch-up:</p>
<pre><code>ECV = C + YE + CU

ECT: Expected Company Value
C: Capital
YE: Yield Expectation
CU: Catch-up
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you can write up the expected company value in the following way:</p>
<pre><code>ECV = (C + YE) / IS

ECT: Expected Company Value
C: Capital
YE: Yield Expectation
IS: Investor Shares
(IS is normalizet to the 0-1 interval)
</code></pre>
<p>From the two equation above, you can write up, that the catch-up can be calculated based on the capital, yield and the amount of the shares held by the investor:</p>
<pre><code>CU = ((C + YE) / IS) - (C + YE)
</code></pre>
<p>This value is basically the maximum possible value of the catch-up. If you sold your company for less than the expected company value, then you will get less than this caluclated catch-up value.</p>
<p>In the following graph, you can see how the expected company value grows with time, and how it is composed:</p>
<div class="canvas-wrapper"><canvas id="catch-up"></canvas></div>
<!--
Itt megmutatni, hogy a cégérték és a befektető elvárásának különbsége az pont a catch-up
-->
<p>It works in the following way: let's say that X is the amount of the capital plus interest, the investor holds 20% of the shares, and you sold your company for Y. At this stage the founders will get the catch-up, that is based on X and proportional to the ratio of the investor's and the founders' shares. In this example, the founders hold 80% of the shares, that means they have four times more shares than the investor. It means, that they will get $1.728M * 4 = $6.912M.</p>
<p>After all of this, try to think with an <strong>investor's head</strong>. If you sell the company for more than the capital plus yield expectation BUT less than the expected company value, then the investor will get the same amont of money, even though there can be huge differences for you due to the catch-up mechanism. It means, they will not be motivated to sell the company for more, because they will not get more. <strong>The only case they get more is if you can sell the company for more than the expected company value!</strong></p>
<h3 id="payout3shares">Payout 3: Shares</h3>
<p>Finally, if there's any money left, then every shareholder gets the money from the remaining based on the amount of <strong>shares</strong> they hold. Again, it only happens, if you can sell the company for more than the - previously described - expected company value.</p>
<h2 id="exampleexitscenarios">Example Exit-Scenarios</h2>
<p>Now, you are already familiar with the three-step payout process, so let's see what happens if you sell your company for $1.5M, $5M and $10M respectively with and without catch-up. (I still assume that you sell the whole company after 3 years and the investor holds 20% of the shares.)</p>
<h3 id="anexampleexitscenariod15mafter3years">An Example Exit-Scenario: $1.5M After 3 Years</h3>
<p>If you sell the company for $1.5M, then you will get $0, because the amount of capital plus interest is $1.728M. This scenario is also bad news for the investor, because they don't even get the minimal amount that they expected. This can happen though, if they want to cut their losses.</p>
<h3 id="anexampleexitscenariod5mafter3yearswithcatchup">An Example Exit-Scenario: $5M After 3 Years With Catch-up</h3>
<p>If you sell the company for $5M, and the investor offered you catch-up, then first they get $1.728M. The remaining is $3.272, which is less then the amount of the calculated value of the catch-up - that was $6.912M in this case -, so the founders get $3.272M. It basically means that the investor gets 34.56% of the money and the founders get 65.44%, even though the investor only had 20% and the founders had 80% of the company.</p>
<div class="canvas-wrapper"><canvas id="exit5m-catchup"></canvas></div>
<h3 id="anexampleexitscenariod5mafter3yearswithoutcatchup">An Example Exit-Scenario: $5M After 3 Years Without Catch-up</h3>
<p>If there is no catch-up in the equation, then the founders get much less. Similarly to the case above, the investor gets $1.728M, and after that, everybody gets from the remaining ($3.272M) proporionally to their shares. So, the investor gets another $0.6544M thousand ($3.272M * 0.2), and the founders get $2.6176M ($3.272M * 0.8). It means that the investor gets $1.728M + $0.6544M = $2.3824M, that is 47.648% of the exit-money. Now, you understand why I said that don't accept an offer without full catch-up!</p>
<div class="canvas-wrapper"><canvas id="exit5m-nocatchup"></canvas></div>
<h3 id="anexampleexitscenariod10mafter3yearswithcatchup">An Example Exit-Scenario: $10M After 3 Years With Catch-up</h3>
<p>Now, let's see the optimal case, when the exit is big enough compared to the invesment (the $10M case), and there is catch-up. So, as we seen previously, first of all, the investor gets the capital plus interest, which is $1.728M. Secondly, the founders get the catch-up money, that is $6.912M. If you substract these from the $10M, the remaining is $1.36M. The investor gets an extra $0.272M ($1.36M * 0.2) from the remaining, since they hold 20% of the shares and the founders get an extra $1.088M ($1.36 * 0.2) respectively. It means, that the investor gets exactly $2M and the founders get $8M, which are exactly the proportional to the shares they have.</p>
<div class="canvas-wrapper"><canvas id="exit10m-catchup"></canvas></div>
<p>So, if the exit is big enough and there is catch-up in the deal, then everybody will get exactly the same amount as if there were splitting the money based on the amount of the shares they hold. As you can imagine, this scenario is also much worse for the founders if they don't get catch-up money, but since you saw so many examples, it's a homework for you to calculate that case.</p>
<h2 id="theexitscenariomatrix">The Exit-Scenario Matrix</h2>
<p>In order to gain a full picture how good an investment offer is, you should calculate as many exit-scenarios as you can. That means that you have to write up different exit-values after different amount of years, since the yield expectation increases proportionally to the time passed after the investment.</p>
<p>If you write these up for all of the investment offers you get, <strong>you will be able to compare your investors based on numbers</strong>. Also, it's a very, very good method to bargain <strong>better offers</strong> from them, since you can show them that the other investor has a better offer considering many exit-scenarios.</p>
<p>Basically, you have to write up a matrix, in which one dimension is the passed years from the point of the investment and the other represents different exit values:</p>

<p>In the matrix above, you can see <strong>one hundred</strong> different exit-scenarios. I highlighted with a greenish color those scenarios in which the founders get exactly the amount of money as if the exit money was split based on the shares only. (Those are the optimal scenarios for founders, meaning, that they get the maximum possible amount from the exit value.) Also, the red cells show those cases in which the founders get nothing.</p>
<p>You can also create this kind of matrix for the investors, but more importantly you can create these matrices for <strong>multiple investment offers</strong>. If you substract those matrices, you will see <strong>which investor's offer is better in more scenarios!</strong></p>

<p>In the example above, the investor has 20% of the shares and their yield expectation is 20% as well.</p>
<p>Let's see the matrix with another investor that has only 10% of the shares, but their yield expectation is 30%.</p>

<p>As you can see above, in this scenario, the money ending up in your pocket never reached the level that you would get if only the amount of shares were considered.</p>
<p>If we substract this matrix from the previous one, then we get:</p>

<p>Positive numbers show the cases in which the first investor's offer is better, whereas negative numbers identicate that in those scenarios, the second investor's offer is better. Zeros show that the offers are equally good in those cases. (Most of the cases it means, that you end up with nothing in both cases.)</p>
<p>You might be surprised to see that the first investor's offer means more money in your pocket in 67 scenarios out of 100 (highlighted with blue), whereas the second investor's offer is only better in 6 scenarios (highlighted with green). (The remaining 27 scenarios are equally good for you, because you end up with nothing.) So for example if the number in a cell is -0.3, it means that you get 0.3 more from the second investor in that case, and if its let's say 0.1 it means you get that much more from the first investor in that case.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it means that less percentage of the shares with more yield expectation is only benefitial if you can sell the company for a LOT of money very, very quickly. If you need more time to build your company, you should lower the yield expectation as much as you can, because that is the exponential part of the equation.</p>
<p><strong>Showing a comparision matrix like this to your potential investor is a very, very good way to bargain better conditions.</strong></p>
